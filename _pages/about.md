I am a senior at Harvard College pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Economics. I am currently seeking post-grad opportunities as a software engineer.

My computer science coursework includes preparation in machine learning, systems programming and hardware, signal processing, and algorithms. My economics coursework includes urban economics with [Ed Glaeser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Glaeser), deep-learning methods in data retrieval, and international trade. Courtesy of a liberal arts education, I have also enjoyed my courses in comparative politics, Chinese ethical theory, and existentialism. 

Outside of the classroom, I am a co-chair of my [dormitory](https://dunster.harvard.edu/people/avi-gulati). I am also a mentor ("Peer Advising Fellow") to first-year students, as they navigate their transition to college. These roles on campus reflect my enthusiasm for actively engaging in and contributing to my community.

Thanks for visiting my website. Please feel free to shoot me an email or a LinkedIn message if you are hiring. 

Hello stranger. Welcome to my website. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

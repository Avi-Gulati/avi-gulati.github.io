I graduated this May with a double major in Computer Science and Economics.

My computer science coursework included preparation in machine learning, systems programming, hardware, signal processing, and algorithms. I served as the Head Teaching Fellow for my department's introductory discrete mathematics course. My economics coursework included urban economics, deep-learning methods in data retrieval, and international trade. For two years, I was a teaching fellow for the department's intermediate macroeconomics course. 

Outside of the classroom, I was a co-chair of one of Harvard's 12 upperclassmen [houses](https://dunster.harvard.edu/people/avi-gulati). I was also a mentor ("Peer Advising Fellow") to first-year students, as they navigated their transitions to college. These roles reflected my enthusiasm for actively engaging in and contributing to my campus community.
